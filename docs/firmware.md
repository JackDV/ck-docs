# Firmware Guide

All keyboard sold by CannonKeys are powered by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/)

In order to create firmware for your keyboard, you have a couple options.

## Easy Option

The easiest option to create firmware is to use [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/cannonkeys/ortho48/LAYOUT_ortho_4x12).
Our boards are under the `cannonkeys` namespace. This will give you a graphical interface for creating your desired keymap.

## More Hands-on Option

If you'd like to customize more than just a keymap, the best place to start is the [QMK Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
Follow the guide up until the flashing portion, and then follow our [flashing guide](flashing.md)
